FundMeUp is a modern, user-friendly platform that reimagines how scholarships are funded.

Instead of relying on banks or institutions, FundMeUp enables **direct donor-to-student support using crypto**, eliminating fees, delays, middlemen, and borders.  
This project is built to showcase **frontend craftsmanship**, **product design**, and a **meaningful Web3 use case** for my portfolio.

- **Students** to apply for scholarships  
- **Donors** to directly support verified students  
- **Crypto-based transactions** that are fast, transparent, and borderless  

**Goal:** Empower students worldwide with accessible education funding.
